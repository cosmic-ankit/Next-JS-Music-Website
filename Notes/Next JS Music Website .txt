************* Next JS Music Website ****************

********* Lecture - 1 ***************

* npx create-next-app@latest .

We add . to create the next app within the same project

* The project name should be in lower case

* Typescript introduces the data type in js 

* EsLint -> Eslinting is to find the error like comma miss etc

* Src directory if u want to structure your code within src

* There are two types of routing in next js :-

* Page router -> Previous version
* App router -> New version

* import alias -> 
In react we used to give path using . and / to go into a directory or to import any component, rather we can directly use alias and use @ to point the root directory.



********* File Structure ***********
* npm run dev to start a next app. Go to script within package.json and check out there

* ts get compiled in js, that is why tsconfig is there which next js uses to compile it in js  

* Tailwind config is also there we are gonna add alot of plugins within it later
for animations etc.

* postcss config is for teailwind

* next config -> if u want to change any confriguation of next js then u can do it from here

* eslintrc is the file which gives u suggestion about errors etc

******** Src *************

* All the files are kept here .
* Every code is written within app

* Next js mai jo bhi foler banega ya component banega to uska layout hoga and page hoga

* Layout -> It is a wrapper
* Page -> It serve the content

********** Layout ************

* Meta data import fist line
* inter font, have alot of default fonts

* Title and description is in meta data

* Rootlayout function :- Jo bhi children aate hai wo rootlayout render kar deta hai

* Children come form pages, ye page layout se render hota hai.

* After taking a children as a argument or props in a rootlayout function, readonly and reactnode is a type which is saying that the argument should be of reactnode type else the function wont accept it.

* That is the use of ts we can declare the type here

* Lets create a folder "chai" within app ->chai.jsx. But it will show error or wont work, we have to make every component within page. So we will create page.jsx here

* Now where we can see this page, in next js the routes automatically form as we make folder within app.
So if u run url/chai, the chai page will render there

* Layout render all the pages

* If we create a layout within the chai folder and also write something like "Hello World" in chai layout. And "hello root directory" within the Root Layout.

And if we hit /chai request
Then we will see both of them there along with chai.
That is because chai layout will render chai page and then that chai layout will also be render by root layout.
